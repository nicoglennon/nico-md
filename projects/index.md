## üåº Percent

**[Percent](https://percent.me)** is a web app to track overarching life goals and analyze if you're actually sticking to them.

The idea came from a personal process I've been doing myself for the past few months to track & quantify my life on a weekly basis ‚Äî although the first version was a spreadsheet with a bunch of formulas, I thought I had enough feature ideas to justify building a standalone product.

## üß¨ React.js

I run the **React.js Green Bay meetup** ‚Äî you can check out some of my presentations about [interacting with databases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVdMhKN2ng4&list=PL6ubUCP07zW6_AyMYUNohwKq2NQDlZigO&index=1), the [history of React state](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bucBLOSUt0&list=PL6ubUCP07zW6_AyMYUNohwKq2NQDlZigO&index=3), or [integrating Storybook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PL6ubUCP07zW6_AyMYUNohwKq2NQDlZigO&v=p2sZKAPOQXs&feature=emb_title). More info at the [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/reactjs-green-bay/) page.

## üîÆ Someday

An iOS app built for those of us living one day at a time. Built in React Native, coming soon to the App Store.

## üêÄ Few York

Inspired by Elon's _Occupy Mars_ t-shirt, I created [**@fewyork**](http://fewyork.com) in 2018 after being caught in the middle of the friendly rivalry between the west and east-coast biz worlds. I thought it would be cool to design two collections ‚Äî one based on a SF startup mindset and the other based on a NYC finance mindset.

I've only had time to design a handful of SF ones (which I really like), but more are on the way. Email me at **hi@fewyork.com** if you have any design ideas!

## üéè Zen

With **[Zen](http://zen.glitch.me),** I wanted to create a small set of 'rooms' that would take me somewhere peaceful. I was feeling some stress at the time and wished there was something pretty but boring to fall into for a quick mental break.

It's built using [three.js](http://threejs.org) and runs on [Glitch](http://glitch.com), a really cool platform to build small projects.

## ‚õ∞ Sucursal

A group of friends and I, all now living & working outside of our home country of Colombia, got together in 2020 and started **[Sucursal](https://sucursal.org)**, a remote non-profit organization looking to accelerate our country's long-term economic progress via access to education.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Salesforce Starter

While at IBM I learned to develop in Salesforce and wrote some documentation for myself. I figured if anyone wants to save themselves a headache, they can avoid the endless Salesforce on-boarding docs and just read what I distilled [here](https://www.notion.so/bdbf8cd356184675b19451f8166e3add).

## üò∏ Felist

**[Felist](http://feli.st)** is a minimal organizer. I hated having to decide between a bunch of todo-list apps that were complete overkills for what I needed (I even [wrote a semi-popular post](https://medium.com/the-mission/searching-for-the-perfect-to-do-list-app-934a04f6328) about). So here's a sleek & minimal app to save you and me from todo-list oblivion.

## üìö Tutoring

I'm one of the top programming tutors on [Wyzant](https://www.wyzant.com)! I'm the top search result for HTML, JavaScript, Ruby, etc. I even got my own URL: [wyzant.com/tutors/nico](https://wyzant.com/tutors/nico).

I love to learn different technologies by getting involved in other people's pet projects. If you're interested, email me at **hi@nico.gl** for more info.
