### üåº [Percent](https://percent.me)

**[Percent](https://percent.me)** is a web app to track overarching life goals and analyze if you're actually sticking to them.

The idea came from a personal process I've been doing myself for the past few months to track & quantify my life on a weekly basis ‚Äî although the first version was a spreadsheet with a bunch of formulas, I thought I had enough feature ideas to justify building a standalone product.

### üêÄ [Few York](https://fewyork.com)

Inspired by Elon's *Occupy Mars* t-shirt, I created [**@fewyork**](http://fewyork.com) in 2018 after being caught in the middle of the friendly rivalry between the west and east-coast biz worlds. I thought it would be cool to design two collections ‚Äî one based on a SF startup mindset and the other based on a NYC finance mindset.

I've only had time to design a handful of SF ones (which I really like), but more are on the way. Email me at **hi@fewyork.com** if you have any design ideas!

### üéè [Zen](https://zen.glitch.me)

With **[Zen](http://zen.glitch.me),** I wanted to create a small set of 'rooms' that would take me somewhere peaceful. I was feeling some stress at the time and wished there was something pretty but boring to fall into for a quick mental break.

 It's built using [three.js](http://threejs.org) and runs on [Glitch](http://glitch.com), a really cool platform to build small projects.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è [Salesforce](https://www.notion.so/bdbf8cd356184675b19451f8166e3add)

While at IBM I learned to develop in Salesforce and wrote some documentation for myself. I figured if anyone wants to save themselves a headache, they can avoid the endless Salesforce on-boarding docs and just read what I distilled [here](https://www.notion.so/bdbf8cd356184675b19451f8166e3add).

### üò∏ [Felist](https://feli.st)

**[Felist](http://feli.st)** is a minimal organizer. I hated having to decide between a bunch of todo-list apps that were complete overkills for what I needed (I even [wrote a semi-popular post](https://medium.com/the-mission/searching-for-the-perfect-to-do-list-app-934a04f6328) about). So here's a sleek & minimal app to save you and me from todo-list oblivion.
