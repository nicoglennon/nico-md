## üåº Percent

**[Percent](https://percent.me)** is a web app to track overarching life goals and analyze if you're actually sticking to them.

The idea came from a personal process I've been doing myself for the past few months to track & quantify my life on a weekly basis ‚Äî although the first version was a spreadsheet with a bunch of formulas, I thought I had enough feature ideas to justify building a standalone product.

## üîÆ Someday

An iOS app made for those of us living one day at a time. Coming soon to the App Store!

## üíñ Emosh

[Emosh](https://emosh.substack.com) is a personally-curated 7-track playlist dropping every week. Subscribe [here](https://emosh.substack.com) to get it right in your inbox on Tuesday mornings.

## üêÄ Another Day in the Simulation

Inspired by Elon's _Occupy Mars_ t-shirt, I created [**ADITS**](http://adits.world) in 2018 after spending too much time thinking about the simulation theory. First collection is out (Classic) -- store is paused while I create a few more collections!

## üß¨ React Meetup

I ran the **React.js meetup** in Green Bay ‚Äî you can check out some of my presentations about [interacting with databases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVdMhKN2ng4&list=PL6ubUCP07zW6_AyMYUNohwKq2NQDlZigO&index=1), the [history of React state](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bucBLOSUt0&list=PL6ubUCP07zW6_AyMYUNohwKq2NQDlZigO&index=3), or [integrating Storybook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PL6ubUCP07zW6_AyMYUNohwKq2NQDlZigO&v=p2sZKAPOQXs&feature=emb_title).

## üéè Zen

With **[Zen](http://zen.glitch.me),** I wanted to create a small set of 'rooms' that would take me somewhere peaceful. I was feeling a lot of stress at the time and wished there was something pretty but boring to fall into for a quick mental break.

It's built using [three.js](http://threejs.org) and runs on [Glitch](http://glitch.com), a really cool platform to build small projects.

## üò∏ Felist

**[Felist](http://feli.st)** is a minimal organizer. I hated having to decide between a bunch of todo-list apps that were complete overkills for what I needed (I even [wrote a semi-popular post](https://medium.com/the-mission/searching-for-the-perfect-to-do-list-app-934a04f6328) about). So here's a sleek & minimal app to save you and me from todo-list oblivion.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Salesforce Starter

While at IBM I learned to develop in Salesforce and wrote some documentation for myself. I figured if anyone wants to save themselves a headache, they can avoid the endless Salesforce on-boarding docs and just read what I distilled [here](https://www.notion.so/bdbf8cd356184675b19451f8166e3add).

## üìö Tutoring

I'm one of the top programming tutors on [Wyzant](https://www.wyzant.com)! I'm the top search result for HTML, JavaScript, Ruby, etc. I even got my own URL: [wyzant.com/tutors/nico](https://wyzant.com/tutors/nico).

I love to learn different technologies by getting involved in other people's pet projects. If you're interested, email me at **hi@nico.gl** for more info.
